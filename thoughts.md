# Stonks
## Natural language processing




# Crypto

# Features
* Get more recent data -> day until now!

# Improvements
* Save weekly and daily model, separately
* Get twitter mentions of coins per day

## Volatility Problem
* Discard first few weeks of each coin since its going crazy
* Remove outliers:
  * targets that are higher than 200 % / lower than -200 % or
  * only keep central 90%
  * 
* Test set sampling:
  * Dont take the most recent data as test set but randomly interspersed instead
